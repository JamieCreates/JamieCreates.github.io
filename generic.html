								<p>As an English major and all around nerd, I would love to work in a creative field that would allow me to flex that squishy, imaginative organ we call a brain. Writing is my biggest passion and I am determined to make it a part of my career.</p>
								<p>Though my creative writing experience is all either for school or fun, I have plenty of professional technical writing experience. When I was a training manager with Bartech Systems, I created many technical documents, including an engineering manual that I collaborated with the engineering department to make. I learned the hardware and software used in their minibar systems inside and out to create those materials to ensure their quality; I am familiar with the teamwork and personal drive required to be a successful technical and creative writer. I also personally trained and lead teams in the F&B setting throughout North America and have been fortunate enough to work with many people across the globe.</p>
								<p>As a member of the LGBT+ community, I am exceptionally open minded and understanding towards the myriad of different cultures, beliefs, and orientations that make our world a more interesting and beautiful place. That being said, I only wish to work with companies that value diversity and inclusivity, as that is a topic very near and dear to my heart.</p>
								<p>I'm looking forward to an exciting new adventure! Are you ready?</p>
								<p>Roll for initiative!</p>
